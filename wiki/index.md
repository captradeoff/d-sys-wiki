# d-sys.wiki

**d-sys.wiki** is your home for all things [distributed systems](/fundamentals).

## purpose

this wiki was created to be easily consumed by humans and [ai](/llms.txt) to enhance distributed systems skills.

## features

in addition to simple casual explanations on how to architect and build distributed systems, **d-sys.wiki** provides: 

- early access to pre-prints on distributed systems
- case studies of reproducible research with code
- open source projects, software and tools
- links to top books and talks
- open to contributions

...and more! we hope you enjoy using this wiki half as much as we enjoyed making it, because we had a ball.
