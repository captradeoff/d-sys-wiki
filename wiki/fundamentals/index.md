## what are distributed systems?

**distributed systems** are networks of independent computers (nodes) communicating through message passing, collaboratively delivering unified services or achieving shared objectives. each node maintains its own memory, processing capability, and local storage, working concurrently and autonomously. nodes interact through standardized protocols and interfaces, allowing the system to function effectively across geographic distances, network delays, and varied hardware or software platforms. the primary advantages of distributed systems include scalability, fault tolerance, resilience, and efficient resource utilization, ensuring consistent performance even if individual nodes fail.

fundamentally, distributed systems embody three essential properties described by the **cap theorem**:

- **consistency**: ensuring all nodes have a synchronized and accurate view of data.
- **availability**: providing reliable access and responses to user requests.
- **partition tolerance**: maintaining operation despite network partitions or node failures.

since the cap theorem dictates that no system can simultaneously achieve all three, architects must strategically balance these properties based on specific application requirements.

distributed systems employ diverse architectural patterns to address varying use cases. for instance, a **client-server architecture** centralizes resource management with dedicated servers responding to client requests, ideal for predictable workloads. in contrast, **peer-to-peer architectures** distribute responsibilities evenly among equivalent nodes, improving resilience and scalability. **microservices** structures decompose applications into loosely coupled, independent services, streamlining development and deployment. **event-driven architectures** utilize asynchronous communication via events or messages, enhancing flexibility and responsiveness. finally, **service-oriented architectures (soa)** encapsulate functionalities into reusable, interoperable services with standardized interfaces.

typical distributed system components include:

| component                  | role                                                  | example technologies      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **load balancer**          | evenly distribute client requests                     | aws elb, nginx            |
| **message queue**          | asynchronous message handling between services        | apache kafka, aws sqs     |
| **database (relational)**  | structured, consistent data storage                   | postgres, mysql           |
| **database (nosql)**       | flexible, scalable data storage                       | mongodb, dynamodb         |
| **cache**                  | store frequently accessed data, reducing latency      | redis, memcached          |
| **orchestration platform** | automate service deployment, scaling, and management  | kubernetes, aws ecs       |
| **consensus algorithm**    | achieve agreement on shared state across nodes        | paxos, raft               |

designing a robust distributed system demands consideration of latency, throughput, network efficiency, and reliability through meticulous fault detection and recovery strategies. architects must thoughtfully select appropriate consistency models (strong vs. eventual consistency), devise effective data replication and sharding schemes, and implement rigorous security measures—including authentication, authorization, and encryption—to guard against unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
